# Squash Analyzer architecture

## Local-first data flow

SwiftUI features call `MatchRepository`; the repository is the only write path for coach matches. `SwiftDataMatchRepository` upserts one `SavedMatch` with child games, points and lets under stable UUIDs.

The lifecycle is:

1. Create and persist a match when setup completes.
2. Persist after every point, let and undo.
3. Persist when a game changes or the app becomes inactive/backgrounded.
4. Mark the match `completed` or `abandoned` instead of creating another copy.
5. Offer the most recently updated `inProgress` match for recovery at launch.

SwiftData remains the primary store. CloudKit database sync is disabled intentionally. iCloud Drive is used only for explicit, versioned backup files.

## Persistence safety

- `SquashAnalyzerSchemaV1` (frozen nested copies of the models as shipped in 2.2 build 5) is the baseline `VersionedSchema`; `SquashAnalyzerSchemaV2` (adds `SavedPlayer.photoData`) references the live classes and is the current schema (`SquashAnalyzerCurrentSchema`).
- Future model changes must add a new `VersionedSchema` (turning the previous current one into frozen nested copies) and a `MigrationStage`; do not edit an already shipped historical schema definition.
- A failed store open never deletes the store. Store files are copied to `Application Support/Recovery/<timestamp>` and the app starts with a clearly disclosed in-memory fallback.
- Full backups use a versioned envelope containing schema version, app version and a SHA-256 checksum.
- Restore validates and decodes the entire backup before deleting existing records.
- The seven newest dated iCloud backups plus `latest-backup.json` are retained.

## Domain rules

`ScoringEngine` owns the pure scoring rules (11 points, win by 2). UI code and persistence models should not duplicate those rules; `Game` and `RefereeMatch` both delegate to it. Add new rule behavior to the engine with tests first.

`RefereeMatch` owns the service rules for referee mode: a server who wins the rally alternates service box, a hand-out puts the new server in their preferred box (right by default; tapping Links/Rechts for a player stores that box as their hand-out default for the rest of the match, e.g. for a left-hander), and the winner of a game serves first in the next game from their preferred box. Every rally won is recorded in `pointHistory`, which drives the scoring line between the two players.

## Tests

`SquashAnalyzerTests` currently covers game completion, extension scoring, service/undo, unforced-error entry, empty statistics, repository upsert/recovery, backup checksum rejection, and the referee service rules (box alternation, hand-out, per-player preferred box, undo, next-game server).


## Release

- TestFlight: bump `CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`, then `xcodebuild archive` + `xcodebuild -exportArchive` (method `app-store-connect`, destination `upload`) with the App Store Connect API key (`~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys`, key id in `scripts/asc_api.py`). Distribution signing is cloud-managed via `-allowProvisioningUpdates`.
- App Store screenshots: `scripts/screenshots.sh` builds a Debug app, launches it on the iPhone 17 Pro Max simulator once per `ScreenshotScenario` (`-screenshot <name>`, Debug builds only) and saves 6.9" PNGs to `screenshots/nl-NL`. `scripts/upload_screenshots.py` replaces the iPhone 6.9" set of the current `MARKETING_VERSION` in App Store Connect (`--create-version` when the version does not exist yet, `--dry-run` to preview).
